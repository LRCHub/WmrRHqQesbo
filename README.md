[00:00.57] I feel kinda fly standin' next to you
[00:06.05] Baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
[00:09.99] Would you tell me the truth?
[00:11.98] Stay with me and love me through the night, endlessly
[00:19.13] I'ma keep on all my chains when I'm makin' love to you
[00:23.96] Hold me close and let me squeeze you tight through the night
[00:29.90] But, baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
[00:34.08] Would you tell me the truth?

[00:58.25] Tell me, am I doin' it right?
[01:12.75] 
[01:00.37] I told mamma to come ride in the front (Baby)
[01:03.67] I let my K fly hood to the floor (Si)
[01:06.54] Throw a wholе tre-five up in the blunt (You know I been doing this)
[01:11.77] No cap I lеt the cape fly, look like the magic carpet or something
[01:15.97] Or Latin drapes, ahh

[01:18.33] European tour-dates stop
[01:19.73] So baby won't you make my day and tell me a straight lie
[01:22.78] Tell me this the best you ever durag
[01:24.96] The sway that its the knot in the front
[01:26.72] I made that kitty smoke her mom say "Uhuh not in the front"
[01:29.77] ("Dashawn, you know better than to be smoking in front of
[01:30.92] My house, take that to the backyard, I don't say nothing")
[01:33.06] Sorry mamma, but your daughters the one
[01:36.30] We just finished round six, started at one
[01:39.17] We harmonize when we bust (hmm)
[01:40.73] The art of the gun
[01:41.86] I lay it down like my edges in the womb of my scarf
[01:44.86] I got the blue like Melly rolled the Keisha in sport
[01:47.61] I told mamma to come ride in the front (Tie mine)
[01:51.89] I let my K fly hood to the floor (Oh)

[01:58.92] Say this here your daddy house
[02:00.43] Condoms stay so rigid now
[02:01.94] I got so many protectors style
[02:03.33] Twist n turns, we gon jump, so natural
[02:06.89] (Si, baby, I know, you think I'm handsome)
[02:27.89] 
[02:12.20] Martin Luther silk, come through putting balls on your scalp
[02:15.29] Don't need no Head n' Shoulders, I got used to get flaking out
[02:18.16] The top your head, girl we moisturized from this point on out
[02:21.16] I'm your man, can't you see that I've been doing shit

[02:30.22] Hottie got me hot and bothered when she pulled out her silky
[02:33.07] Hottie got me hot and bothered when she pulled out her silky
[02:35.79] Teatree oil rained upon your vessel that's essential drip (Teatree)
[02:38.70] She told me I never gave a fuck so I bought Fendi fits (Fendi)
[02:41.54] Start diving headfirst into your headscarf, head hunted
[02:45.90] (Aye, what that nigga Smi say earlier?)
[02:47.57] Baby, they love love love you when you ass up
[02:50.86] Every time you see my head it's wrapped up
[02:53.37] Caught you in your bonnet that's why I give you backshots
[02:55.97] Just hope you don't backstab me if I should call for backup
[02:59.13] I need some head with that ass, it's too fat (That's crazy)
[03:02.40] When I get tired from ahh, pick up the slack (That's lazy)
[03:05.43] I took a power nap after she threw it back for me
[03:08.10] My durag fell off, I was sleep, she put it back for me (Thank you)
[03:11.12] I feel fire, I feel mythical, I'm fly, I'm a durag dragon
[03:14.43] That's why I showed up to the Grammys with my durag draggin'
[03:17.74] CNN, Vouge, Vouge Japan and GQ
[03:20.84] And I did all of this to meet you
